# Kevin Wilson's Website

This is a simple academic website template.

## Setup and Deployment

This is a jekyll website. You will need ruby in order to build it.
To do so on a Mac using homebrew, run

```bash
$ brew install ruby
```

Once that's installed, you will need to install the dependencies of this
particular project. To do so, run

```bash
$ bundle install
```

To see the website locally, run

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
